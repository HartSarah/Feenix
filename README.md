This is an Entertainer Booking web app that can be used to book entertainers in your local area for parties or events. It was created as part of a group Software Project module. 
<p>Users can sign up as either a Customer or an Entertainer</p>
<p>Customers can search for entertainers using the search bar and can add them to their favourites or book them. If they decide to book, then the entertainer will recieve a booking request on their dashboard and can either accept or decline the request.</p>
<p>Functionalities we wanted to add but did not have time:</p>
<p> - A "view profile" button, so that customers could view an entertainers profile </p>
<p> - A "forgot password" option </p>
<p> - Facebook Login </p>
<p> - Geolocation based search, to show all entertainers close to your current location </p>
<p> - A review system so that customers can review entertainers </p>
